**Test Verification**

Running all tests to check current status:

```bash
# Run the test suite
```

I'll report:
- Total tests run
- Passed / Failed count
- Any error details if tests fail
- Confirmation if ready to commit/refactor

**Quick Status Check:**
- ✓ All green? → Safe to refactor or commit
- ✗ Any red? → Need to fix before proceeding
