description: "Find and show the next test to implement from plan.md"

Let me check plan.md to find the next unmarked/uncompleted test.

I'll:
1. Read plan.md
2. Identify the next test that hasn't been completed
3. Show you what needs to be implemented
4. Ask if you're ready to start the Red phase for this test

This helps track progress through your test plan systematically.
